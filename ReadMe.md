# Bulkmailer Pro
@Michael Habashy - Based this on the github template that I created 

https://github.com/mhabashy/starter-reactjs-firebase-vite-mantine

### This application is used in https://app.bulkmailer.pro this the frontend UI for application that sends mass email. If you like to add to this code make PR.

### - Vite
### - ReactJS
### - Firebase
### - Mantine UI
### - ReactFire
### - Zustand
### - Lodash
### - FontAwesome

In my opinion, this is the best template for building a startup or an application quickly. Making available for other developers, it already has a firebase auth setup and Mantine UI Light/Dark Theme with AppShell.
